         Term::Activity - Process Activity Display Module - vVERSIONTAG

================================================================================
SYNOPSIS:
================================================================================

This module is designed to produce informational STDERR output while a 
process is funinctioning over many iterations or outputs. It is instanced 
with an optional name and other configurable values and is then called on 
each iterative loop.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION:
================================================================================

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================

The information displayed is the current time processed (measured since 
the instancing of the module), the number of actions second, a text-graphic 
indicator of activity (skinnable), and the total count of actions thus far.

An example output (on a small terminal) might appear like this:

  03:13:54 1 : [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\_______________] 9,461

Showing that nearly three hours and 14 minues have occured with a 
current rate of 1 action per second, for a total of 9,461 total actions.
(For the curious, the skin shown is the default skin, AKA 'wave')

The display occurs on a single line that is updated regularly. The 
display automatically calibrates itself so that it appears to update 
approximately once a second.

When the Term::Activity module passes out of scope it updates the display 
with the final time, count, and a newline before exiting.

Term::Activity can resize itself to the width of the current window if
Term::Size is installed. If not, it defaults to an 80-character display.
Term::Size is thouroughly reccomended.

================================================================================
USAGE:
================================================================================

    Refer to the module's POD for detailed usage.

================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES:
================================================================================

Resizing the window during execution may cause the status bar to stop
refreshing properly.

Is the window is too small to accomodate the time, label, count, and 
basic spacing (that is, there is less that 0 spaces for the activity to 
be displayed) the effect, while being preety in a watching-the-car-wreck 
way, it is not informative. Remember to keep your label strings short.
